    <div class="variation-container">
      <div class="variation-text">
      <h4>Fog (of War)</h4>
        
    <p>The grid is covered in fog and only some of the cells are visible.</p>
        <p>Filling in correct digits will clear the fog in the adiacent cells, revealing more numbers to help solve the grid.</p>
        <p>Fog sudoku often make use of other variations, like killer or kropki, to create more challenging puzzles.</p>
        <p>This type of sudoku is only available to play digitally, as it requires a program to remove the fog from the grid.</p>
